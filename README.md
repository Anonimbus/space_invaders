# Space Invaders
This game takes inspiration from "Space Invaders", a 1978 shoot 'em up video game developed and published by [Taito](https://www.taito.co.jp/en/).

This project was derived from a [course](https://youtu.be/FfWpgLFMI7w) uploaded on youtube by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) and created by [@buildwithpython](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCirPbvoHzD78Lnyll6YYUpg)
